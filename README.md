> Generate random text, audio, images, and videos

Urso is a Python library and console application for generating random content. It provides functionalities for generating random text, audio, images, and videos with customizable parameters. Whether you need dummy content for testing, placeholder media, or random data generation, Urso has got you covered.

## Features

* Generate Text: Create random text of a specified number of words.
* Generate Audio: Generate audio with random noise for a given duration.
* Generate Image: Create an image with noise of a specified width and height.
* Generate Video: Produce a video of a given duration and resolution.

## Usage

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Library**: The core functionality is implemented as a Python library. It provides functions to generate random content in different formats.

2. **Console App**: A command-line interface is available to generate individual content items. The console app allows users to specify the desired parameters and output file for each content type.

3. **Flask Server**: A Flask server exposes RESTful APIs to generate content programmatically. It provides endpoints for generating text, audio, images, and videos with customizable parameters.

## Getting Started

To use Urso in your Python project, simply import the library and call the relevant functions for generating the desired content.

To generate content via the console app, execute the appropriate command with the desired parameters.

For programmatic access, interact with the Flask server's API endpoints to generate content on the fly.
